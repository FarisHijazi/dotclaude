# Migrate Claude Code History

The user has moved (or is about to move) this project to a new directory. Run the migration script to copy the conversation history so `claude --continue` works at the new location.

**Old path (current):** The current working directory (use `pwd`)
**New path:** $ARGUMENTS

Run this command:
```
uvx https://github.com/farishijazi/claude-migrate.git cp "$(pwd)" "$ARGUMENTS"
```

After running, tell the user:
1. The history has been copied
2. They can now `cd $ARGUMENTS && claude --continue` to resume
